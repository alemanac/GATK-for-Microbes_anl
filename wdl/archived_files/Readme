Mapq0 and CNV calling script

**What does it do?**     
This python script tabulates a comprehensive list of mapq0 and CNV regions in a genome. A mapq0 region is described as a region where there are a considerable number of mapq0 reads. A CNV region is described as an area where the mean number of reads greatly increases from the mean number of reads in that contig.

**What data does it require as input?**  
This script requires a BAM file as input. Optional inputs include the maximum distance between mapq0 features allowed for mapq0 features to be merged (default is 0, meaning only overlapping and/or book-ended features are merged) and the minimum number of mapq0 reads that must be present for the region to be outputted (default is 50).

**What does it output?** .    
A BED file.
